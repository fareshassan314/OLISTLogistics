# OLISTLogistics

Olist is an online e-commerce store which sells and delivers items all over Brazil. The Logistics Manager doesn't receive any reporting and works off a few spreadsheets.

He is responsible for optimizing the purchase and delivery process. He explains below what this consists of:

When a customer orders from us, they make a purchase online. We then deliver all the orders. It is important for us to deliver orders within the estimated delivery date we have given to the customer otherwise the customers complain if their order is late. I want to have a line of sight of orders that have not been delivered yet.

Using this information, he would like the following on a monthly basis:
* Total Orders per Month
* Number of orders delivered after the estimated delivery date given to the customer
* Orders outstanding delivery

The data is supplied.
